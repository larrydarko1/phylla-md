Phylla (formerly "Leaf") is a **local-first, privacy-focused note-taking app** for desktop built with **Electron**, **Vue 3**, and TypeScript. Inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), Phylla provides a clean, distraction-free environment for managing your notes with local AI capabilities. All your data stays on your device - no cloud, no database, no tracking.

> **Prebuilt binaries are published for Linux only.** macOS and Windows build fine from source —
> see [Other platforms](#other-platforms) for why they aren't shipped and how to build your own.

- **Powered by llama.cpp** - Uses [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) bindings to [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) (both MIT licensed)

### Privacy & Storage

- **Fully offline** - AI inference, dictation, and notes all run locally; the app makes no network requests at all
- **Local-only** - Notes never leave your device
- **User-accessible files** - Direct access to your vault folder
- **No database** - Plain text files you can open anywhere
- **No tracking** - Zero telemetry or data collection

### Design

- **Obsidian-inspired UI** - Clean, familiar interface
- **Multi-language support** - 14 built-in languages with easy language switching; add your own translations
- **Theme customization** - 4 built-in color themes; drop in your own for automatic detection

## Security & Privacy

Phylla is built with privacy and security as core principles:

### Privacy Guarantees

- **No telemetry** - No collection of any usage data, analytics, or crash reports
- **No network requests** - The app makes no outbound connections; no note data or usage data is ever transmitted
- **No cloud sync** - Your notes never leave your device unless you explicitly copy them
- **No accounts** - No sign-ups, logins, or user tracking of any kind
- **Local AI** - AI inference runs entirely on your hardware; no data is sent to any server

### Security Architecture

- **Sandboxed renderer** - Context isolation prevents unauthorized system access
- **Local file system only** - File operations are limited to your selected vault folder
- **No remote code execution** - All code runs locally on your device
- **Open source** - Full transparency - audit the code yourself

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue.** Email the maintainer at <hello@larrydarko.dev> — see [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) for scope and what to expect.

## Data Storage

### Your Notes

Your notes are stored exactly where you choose - simply select any folder on your system as your vault. Common locations:

- **macOS:** `~/Documents/Notes/`, `~/Desktop/MyVault/`
- **Linux:** `~/Documents/Notes/`, `~/notes/`

> **Note:** Your vault folder can be anywhere on your system. Use it with other apps, back it up to external drives, sync with git - it's just plain text files!

### AI Models

Phylla stores AI models in `~/.phylla/models/`. To get started with the AI assistant:

1. Download a `.gguf` model from wherever you like — [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf) is the usual source, and downloading with your own account credentials is faster and works with gated repos
2. Place the file in `~/.phylla/models/` (any `.gguf` file in that folder is picked up, including in subfolders)
3. Open the AI panel by clicking the lightbulb icon in the sidebar
4. Click the **folder** icon to open the models directory, or the **refresh** icon if you added a file while the app was running
5. Select and load the model from the dropdown in the AI panel

> **Tip:** Pick a quantization that fits your RAM — a rough guide is that a `Q4_K_M` file needs about its own file size in free memory, plus room for the context window.

> **Migrating from older versions:** Phylla was previously called Leaf. On first launch it moves `~/.leaf/` to `~/.phylla/` (and older `~/leaf-models/` to `~/.phylla/models/`), carries conversations and app state over from the old `Leaf` app-data folder, and renames each vault's `.leaf/` folder to `.phylla/` when you open it. No action required.

### Themes

Phylla ships with 4 built-in color themes. All themes are stored in `~/.phylla/themes/`:

1. Open the app and click the **palette icon** in the sidebar (or use the theme menu)
2. Select a theme from the built-in list to apply it instantly
3. To add custom themes:
    - Create a new `.json` file in `~/.phylla/themes/` with your color definitions
    - Restart the app — your custom theme appears automatically in the picker

Theme file format (see `~/.phylla/themes/dark.json` for examples):

```json
{
    "name": "My Custom Theme",
    "description": "A Small description",
    "colors": {
        "text1": "#ffffff",
        "bg-primary": "#1e1e1e",
        "accent-color": "#3eb489"
        // ... more color definitions
    }
}
```

Bundled defaults (`dark.json`, `light.json`, etc.) are seeded on first launch and never overwritten if you've edited them.

### Languages & Localization

Phylla supports multiple languages. Currently available:

- **Chinese (simplified)**
- **English** (default)
- **Esperanto**
- **French**
- **German**
- **Greek**
- **Hindi**
- **Italian**
- **Japanese**
- **Korean**
- **Latin**
- **Portuguese**
- **Russian**
- **Spanish**

disclaimer: translations are done by AI, they may be inaccurate.

To switch languages:

1. Click the **language menu** in the settings (top-right or settings panel)
2. Select your preferred language — the UI updates instantly
3. To add your own language translations:
    - Create a new `.json` file in `~/.phylla/locales/` (e.g. `fr.json` for French)
    - Use the format from `~/.phylla/locales/en.json` as a template
    - Restart the app — your new language appears in the language picker

Language file format — translation keys are grouped, and a `meta` block describes the language itself:

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "name": "Français", // display name
        "dictationLanguage": "fr" // used for whisper language detection for dictation
    },
    "app": {
        "select_folder": "Sélectionner un dossier"
    }
    // ... more translation groups
}
```

The two `meta` fields:

| Field               | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | How the language is labelled in the picker, written in itself (e.g. `Français`). Falls back to the file name if omitted.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `dictationLanguage` | The language [dictation](#using-dictation-speech-to-text) transcribes in — a [Whisper language code](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) such as `fr`. Leave it `""` if there is no sensible match, and dictation will detect the language from your voice instead. |

For a complete list of translation keys, check `~/.phylla/locales/en.json`.

### Customising the System Prompt

Phylla ships a small library of system-prompt templates as Markdown files. The active prompt is sent to the model on every load / chat reset, shaping its tone and behaviour.

1. Open the AI panel and click the **chat-bubble icon** in the toolbar — the dropdown lists every template in `~/.phylla/prompts/` with its name and description, and a checkmark on the active one.
2. Click any template to make it active.
3. Click the folder icon to edit templates in your preferred editor.

The templates folder lives at `~/.phylla/prompts/`. Each `*.md` file is one template:

```markdown
---
name: Coding Assistant
description: Focused on programming questions, code review, and refactoring
---

You are a senior software engineer assisting inside a note-taking app.
...
```

- The `---` frontmatter block (`name`, `description`) is optional and used only by the picker UI; it's stripped before being sent to the model.
- Drop new `.md` files into the folder to add your own templates — they appear automatically.
- Bundled defaults (`default.md`, `coding.md`, `writing.md`) are seeded on first launch and never overwritten if you've edited them.

### Using Dictation (Speech-to-Text)

Phylla includes a built-in speech-to-text feature powered by [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) running 100% locally via ONNX:

1. Open any `.txt` or `.md` file in the editor
2. Click the **microphone icon** in the bottom-right corner of the editor
3. On first use, the Whisper model loads from disk (a few seconds)
4. Speak naturally — your speech is transcribed and appended to the file every ~5 seconds
5. Click the microphone again to stop dictation

**Which language it transcribes in.** Dictation follows the language the app is set to, so if the UI is Italian it transcribes Italian. Each locale file declares this via `meta.dictationLanguage` (see [Languages & Localization](#languages--localization)). Guessing the language from a few seconds of audio is unreliable — a bad guess produces gibberish — so it is only used as a fallback, for locales that declare no usable language (custom ones you have written yourself, or languages Whisper does not support, such as Esperanto).

If you speak a different language than your UI is set to, set `meta.dictationLanguage` in that locale file to the language you actually dictate in. For example, keep the app in English but transcribe Italian by putting `"dictationLanguage": "it"` in `~/.phylla/locales/en.json`.

> **The Whisper ONNX model files are not included in this repository.** Before using dictation you need to download them manually — see the [setup step](#speech-to-text-model-setup) below.

#### Speech-to-Text Model Setup

The app uses [`Xenova/whisper-base`](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/whisper-base) from Hugging Face — a multilingual model covering 99 languages. Download the two required quantized ONNX files and place them at the exact paths shown:

```
models/whisper/Xenova/whisper-base/onnx/encoder_model_quantized.onnx
models/whisper/Xenova/whisper-base/onnx/decoder_model_merged_quantized.onnx
```

Download links (right-click → Save Link As):

- [`encoder_model_quantized.onnx`](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/whisper-base/resolve/main/onnx/encoder_model_quantized.onnx)
- [`decoder_model_merged_quantized.onnx`](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/whisper-base/resolve/main/onnx/decoder_model_merged_quantized.onnx)

Or via `curl`:

```sh
mkdir -p models/whisper/Xenova/whisper-base/onnx
curl -L -o models/whisper/Xenova/whisper-base/onnx/encoder_model_quantized.onnx \
  https://huggingface.co/Xenova/whisper-base/resolve/main/onnx/encoder_model_quantized.onnx
curl -L -o models/whisper/Xenova/whisper-base/onnx/decoder_model_merged_quantized.onnx \
  https://huggingface.co/Xenova/whisper-base/resolve/main/onnx/decoder_model_merged_quantized.onnx
```

Once the files are in place, dictation works fully offline — no cloud or API keys needed.

### App Settings

Phylla stores minimal app preferences (like your last opened folder path) automatically. No configuration needed.

### Conversation History

AI conversations are automatically saved as JSON files in Electron's standard `userData` directory:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Phylla/conversations/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Phylla\conversations\`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Phylla/conversations/`

Each conversation is stored as a separate `.json` file containing the model used, timestamps, and the full message history. Conversations are auto-titled from the first message and can be renamed or deleted from the history panel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v24+ recommended)
- npm

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/larrydarko1/phylla-md.git
cd phylla-md
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Run in development mode**

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Testing & Code Quality

```sh
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Lint source code
npm run lint

# Auto-fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Auto-format source code
npm run format

# Run every gate CI runs, in one go
npm run ci:check
```

Tests live in the `tests/` directory and mirror the `src/` structure. On every push and pull request, CI runs lint, formatting and style checks, type-checking, the build, the full test suite with coverage, and the project's standards gates (`larry.config.ts`), the dependency audit among them — the release pipeline only triggers if CI passes.

> **No E2E tests:** Playwright's Electron support remains experimental and broken for Electron 30+ (as of 2026). The --remote-debugging-port flag was removed from the CLI in Electron 30, and the only reliable workaround requires patching your Electron application code via app.commandLine.appendSwitch(). Unit test coverage sits above 80% across all branches and keeps the CI feedback loop fast. E2E support should be revisited once Playwright ships a stable fix for Electron 30+.

### Building for Production

```sh
# Build for your current platform
npm run build:electron

# Build for Linux — the platform this project releases
npm run build:linux

# Build for macOS or Windows — not released, self-build only (see Other platforms)
npm run build:mac
npm run build:win
```

The built installers will be in the `dist-electron/` directory:

- **Linux:** `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.tar.gz` packages
- **macOS:** `.dmg` installer (Apple Silicon / arm64)
- **Windows:** `.exe` NSIS installer

Building the `.rpm` needs the `rpm` tool on the build machine (`sudo apt-get install rpm` on
Debian/Ubuntu); the other Linux targets have no extra prerequisite. `build:mac` has to run on a
Mac and `build:win` on Windows.

### Installing the App

After building:

1. Navigate to `dist-electron/`
2. Double-click the installer for your platform
3. Follow installation prompts
4. Launch "Phylla" from your applications menu

## Other platforms

Releases carry Linux packages only. Shipping macOS and Windows binaries properly means paying for
signing certificates — an Apple Developer ID and a Windows code-signing certificate — and without
them every download either warns people off or gets blocked outright: Gatekeeper calls an unsigned
app "damaged", SmartScreen hides the installer behind "More info". I'd rather not publish binaries
that make you fight your OS to open them. Linux doesn't gatekeep downloads that way, so that's
where releases go.

Building it yourself sidesteps all of that: an app you compiled on your own machine isn't a
download, so neither OS quarantines it and no signature is needed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/larrydarko1/phylla-md.git
cd phylla-md && npm ci

npm run build:mac   # on a Mac — .dmg in dist-electron/
npm run build:win   # on Windows — .exe in dist-electron/
```

This is a solo project, and it's a matter of resources rather than intent — as Phylla grows, proper
signed macOS and Windows releases are on the list.
